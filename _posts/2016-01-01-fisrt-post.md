Hello world! This is my first (official) blog post, and from today I'll start to write tiny but informative 
posts to share my knowledge, also my thoughts with whole world. 
If I can save your time, even a tiny seconds, that would be my pleasure.

Quite often, I've heard the importance of note-taking habits, and it is something that 
I've been always agreed with, especially as a novice junior developer myself.
But there have been tons of excuses stopping me, like, why? what to write about? Am I good enough to write post?
What if I harm people by giving wrong information? And I decided to just stop questioning myself.  

With throwing all the execuses in front of me, I will write things. My English is still bad, but at least
I can write things to people with what I want to talk about. Better late than never, right?
