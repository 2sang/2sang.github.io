Hello world! This is my first (official) blog post, and from today I start out my blog to write tiny but informative 
posts, to share my knowledge, my thoughts with the world.  

Quite often, I've heard about the importance of note-taking habits, and yes, it is something that 
I've been always agreed with, especially as a novice junior developer myself.
But there had been tons of excuses stopping me like, why should I? or what to write about? Am I good enough to write post?
What if I harm people by giving wrong information? And I decided to just stop questioning myself.  

With throwing all the execuses in front of me, I will write things. My English is still bad, but at least
I can write things to people with what I want to talk about. And, Better late than never, right?
